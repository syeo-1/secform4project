### things to keep in mind
#### I'm looking for non-derivative, and non-RSU orders

- in other words, only when people are directly buying and selling shares in a company, I want that information
- the link below is for RSU related acquisition of stock for Jetblue airways

- also since I want non-derivative data, need to know how to recognize and not waste space to save it:
- here's an example for softbank

- i think i should also focus on non-issuer reports, so only officer level and above people purchasing or selling stock!! (so only reporting ones)

## form 4 codes:

https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/ownershipformcodes.html

why's there a huge discrepency with the period of report, and filing/acceptance date for this one:

## form 4 info regarding the two day delay in filing transactions

## what if someone buys and sells at the same time?

### so, there are several transactions within the same report, and all of them are non-derivative!

### form 4 details: (section 8 useful for transaction codes)
- https://www.sec.gov/about/forms/form4data.pdf

### multi purchase
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1878542/000138746725000038/0001387467-25-000038-index.htm

### focus on direct ownership. so this will be D in column 6 table 1
### there can be a mix of things in table 1 (RSU with standard purchase!!)
