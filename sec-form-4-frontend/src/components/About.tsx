                With all the uncertainty within the financial markets that occurs day-to-day, wouldn't it be nice to
                know what people with insider knowledge are up to? Introducing InsiderInsight! This
                web application is dedicated to tracking insider trading activity across US financial markets using public filing
                information submitted to the SEC via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form4.asp">form 4</a>. The focus of this project is
                 to track when insiders are buying and selling shares directly with minimal delay.
